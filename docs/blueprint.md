# **App Name**: HSCM Connect

## Core Features:

- Lead Magnet Modal: Implement a 'First Steps' lead magnet modal that appears as a popup for email capture, offering a resource in exchange, with both light and dark mode themes.
- Visit Planner: Develop a 'Plan Your Visit' modal that contains service details and a simple contact form, ensuring it's appropriately themed for both light and dark modes.
- Decision Follow-Up Form: Create a dedicated page or modal for decision follow-up using the 'I've Raised My Hand' form, applying themes for both light and dark modes.
- Exit-Intent Popup: Implement an exit-intent popup modal on desktop that triggers when the user intends to leave the site, styled for both light and dark modes.
- Dark Mode Toggle: Add a user-clickable icon, likely in the header or footer, that allows switching between Light and Dark themes. The icon should change (e.g., sun/moon) to reflect the current state. The user's choice should be saved in their browser's localStorage to persist across visits.
