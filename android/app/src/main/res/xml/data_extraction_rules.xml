      Configuration for cloud-based backups to the user's Google Drive.
      This is used when a user sets up a new device.

        <!--
          ALWAYS include SharedPreferences. This is where user-specific settings
          like theme preference (light/dark), notification settings, or whether
          they've completed an onboarding flow are stored. This is critical for
          a good user experience on a new device.
        -->
        <include domain="sharedpref" />

        <!--
          EXCLUDE local databases. This app uses Firestore, which is a cloud database.
          There is no local database that needs to be backed up. Excluding this prevents
          potential issues if a temporary database is ever created.
        -->
        <exclude domain="database" />

        <!--
          EXCLUDE local files. App files are typically image caches (from Glide/Picasso)
          or other temporary data that should be re-downloaded, not restored from a backup.
          This makes the backup smaller and faster.
        -->
        <exclude domain="file" />

        <!--
          EXCLUDE the root directory. It's generally best practice to be specific
          about what you include, and the root directory can contain sensitive or
          unnecessary files.
        -->
        <exclude domain="root" />
    </cloud-backup>

    <!--
      Configuration for device-to-device transfers. For this app's architecture,
      the cloud backup rules are sufficient for both scenarios. There are no large,
      non-cloud files that would require a different strategy for direct transfers.
      Therefore, this section can be left commented out.
